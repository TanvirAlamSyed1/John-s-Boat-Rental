#Description of the Code
This code was apart of a project I participated during college.
The Customer was an owner of a boat rental company and wanted to update his way of keeping up with the following:
- Reservations Made
- Log of how long customers made reservations
- customer details
- log of repairs for the boats and what pieces are needed
- whats in stock and what needs to be bough
- enquiries made by customers
- types of boat they have
- boats they have sold to people
